      title: Research Vision & PhD Goals
      text: |
        I aim to develop **embodied agents that learn continuously from interaction** —
        systems that combine the reasoning power of large language models with the grounded
        decision-making of reinforcement learning.

        ### Specific Research Directions
        - **RL for LLM Reasoning:** Train language models to reason through verifiable rewards (GRPO, PPO).
        - **Continual & Lifelong RL:** Design agents that learn new tasks sequentially without forgetting.
        - **Embodied AI & Robotics:** Bridge high-level LLM reasoning with low-level robotic control.
        - **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Decentralized systems with economic incentives and reputation.
